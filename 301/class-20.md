# Class 20

## Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js

- node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications.

- view logs with the command `heroku logs --tail`

- `Procfile` is a text file in the root directory that explicitly declares what command is used to start your app

- `dyno` is a lightweight container that runs the command in the `Procfile` (`ps` is command to check dynos running)
