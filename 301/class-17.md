## What is jQuery

- jQuery is a JavaScript file that you include in your web pages. It lets you find elements using CSS-style selector and then do something with the elements using jQuery methods.

- The jQuery object has many methods that you can use to work with the elements you select. The methods represent tasks that you commonly need to perform with elements.

### Why use jQuery

- jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.

- jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more," because it allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write with plain JavaScript.

### A matched set / jQuery selection

- When you select one or more elements, a jQuery is returned. It is also known as a matched set or a jquery selection.

### jQuery methods that get and set data

- Some jQuery methods both retrieve information from, and update the contents of, elements. But they do not always apply to all elements.

### jQuery objects store references to elements

- When you create a selection with jQuery, it stores a reference to the corresponding nodes in the DOM tree. It does not create copies of them.

### Caching jQuery selections in variables

- A jQuery object stores references to elements. Caching a jQuery object stores a reference to it in a variable.

### Checking a page is ready to work with

- jQuery's .ready() method checks that the page is ready for your code to work with.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Greater efficiency

1. Engaged collaboration

1. Learning from fellow students

1. Social skills

1. Job interview readiness

1. Work environment readiness

I was so uncertain the first time I pair programmed. The very next time I realized just how important and effective it actually was. I learned so much and got to completely see a different perspective. Ever since then I was sold on the benefits and definitely see how valuable it is for both sides. Both sides gets to learn more about programming and they get to practice social skills and gain a new perspective.
