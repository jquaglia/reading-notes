What is observability across the stack and why should you care.

- Logs- cloudwatch

- Metrics- amazon cloudwatch

- Traces- xray

Observability and AWS

Cloudwatch

2 ways this info will change how i will approach career transition

any other key take aways

## Challenges

1. Having to use different SDKs and agents to collect/anaklyse signlas

1. Devs instrumenting apps using different SDKs decreasing velocity

1. Running multiple agents increases resource consumption causing unnecessary costs

1. Manually correlating traces & metrics from a range of source is slow and error-prone

## Open Telemetry

OpenTelemetry enables developers to use a standardized set of open source APIs and agents ton instrument apps once and collect correlated metrics & traces for multiple monitoring solutions.

## How you can benefit

- freedom of choice: use the best of cass for a given use case

- Rely on open standards, most importantly CNCF OpenTelemetry and W3C Trace Context

- With open source, build portable observability systems (e.g. on-premises to cloud migration)
