## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

- Rozovsky got put into a study group for her MBA program.

- The group was high stress and very tense. (Members were bright and nice on their own though)

- Rozovsky's case team also had bright and outgoing people but their group was easy going and fun.

- Psychologists are trying to figure out how to make everyones personal productivity as high as it can be.

- They have figured out that people innovate faster and catch mistakes more in teams.

- People report higher job satisfaction when in a team environment as well.

- Google became focused on building the perfect team

- Rovosky was hired by Google to study people's habits and assigned to Project Aristotle.

- No matter how researchers organized the data, they couldn't find any patterns

- PA began looking at group 'norms' or what the rules of the groups were instead of who was in the groups

- PA concluded that group norms were the key to improving a team.

- The data was highly contradictory though as groups with wildly different norms were both successful

- TEAM B all the way for me!

- Researchers wanted to find out if there was a 'team IQ' that could be measured.

- The good teams were based on how everyone treated eachother.

- In the good teams, everyone got an equal chance to talk. Also, everyone was adept at reading others emotions based on tone of voice and expressions.

- Team B was the right choice becuase there are more chances for everyone to say everything they need to and more chances for everyone else to read emotions

- High levels of Psychological Safety!

- they put the new info to the test with Matt Sakaguchi

- No one wants to put on a work-face when they get to work. They don't want to leave a part of their personality at home. (They want to feel psychologically safe)
