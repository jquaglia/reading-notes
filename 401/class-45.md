## Trees

### Common Terminology

- Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes

- Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree

- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, `k = 2`.

- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree

- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree

- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children

- Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

#### Sample Tree

### Traversals

- Two categories of tree traversals:

  - Depth First

  - Breadth First

### Binary Trees

- Binary trees restrict the number of children to two, hence the left and right children properties.

### K-ary Trees

- If Nodes are able to have more than 2 child nodes, we call this K-ary tree. We use `k` to refer to the max number of children each Node is able to have.

### Binary Search Trees

- A BST is a tree that has some structure attached to it.

- nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
