## Stacks and Queues

### What is a stack

A stack is a data structure that consists of `Nodes`. Each `Node` references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

### Stack Terminology

1. Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed

1. Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

1. Top - This is the top of the stack.

1. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

1. IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

### Stacks follow these concepts

- FILO - First In Last Out

- LIFO - Last In First Out

### Stack Visualization

- Push O(1) - Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many nodes you have in the stack.

- Pop O(1) - Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top node will be re-assigned to the node that lives below and the top node is returned to the user.

- Peek O(1) - When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top node of the stack.

- isEmpty O(1) - Returns a boolean value.

### What is a Queue

A queue is kind of like the opposite of a stack.

### Queue Terminology

1. Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.

1. Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

1. Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.

1. Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

1. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

1. IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

### Queue's follow these concepts

- FIFO - First In First Out

- LILO - Last In Last Out

### Queue visualization

![queue example](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/images/Queue.PNG)

- Enqueue O(1) - When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation

- Dequeue O(1) - When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

- Peek O(1) - When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

- IsEmpty O(1) - Returns a boolean value.
